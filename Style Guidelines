Overall Look and Feel of Autoplow
===============================

The overall look and feel of the website will follow along with the common trend of being flat and modern.
This should reflect to customers that this is a serious business that is appropriately managed and integrated
into the modern era.

Colours
========
Autoplow is a winter based product, so the colours of its website should reflect that. This is why a majority of the colours
scheme is based around white (snow) and light blue (ice). There will also be specks of colours like orange, simply for the 
aesthetic appeal
These are our color swatches:

- #E5F5F5
- #663399
- #EBF7FD
- #FFA500
- #000000
- #BC1E4A

Iconography
===========
We will focus on using icons that have a 'flat' design, which adheres to the overall look and feel. They will also be 
responsive as the user interacts with them (hovering over it) to add a level of engagement between the website and the user

Typography
==========
We will be using Poppins from Google Fonts.

Links
=====
Links will not be underlined and will be presented in a box and will change colour when a user hovers over it.

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat designed using the chosen colors outlined above.
